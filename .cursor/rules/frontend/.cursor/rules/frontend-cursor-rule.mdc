### Coding Environment

The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS (CSS modules)

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use curly braces for if conditions, no single line returns
- Always use css modules styling HTML elements, incase of using tailwind for css, for customized values create the var in tailwind.config.ts file and then use it in the project
- Use rem units for css sizes.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- use kebab case for file names and camel case for components.
- Never use color codes for color values in CSS, use CSS variables from styles/globals.css file.
- For buttons, loading state can be enabled using 'btn' and 'loading' class.
- Functions should be less than 10 lines, if function is exceeding 10 lines, divide into smaller functions.
- useEffect block should be the last block before return in \*.tsx, if there are multiple useEffects, it should be in order descending order of length of dependency array.
